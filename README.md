# Simple_Linear_Regression
In this Notebook you will learn how to use scikit-learn library to implement Simple linear regression. The dataset is related to fuel consumption and Carbon dioxide emission of cars. We split our data into training and test sets, create a model using training set, Evaluate your model using test set, and finally use model to predict unknown value.
